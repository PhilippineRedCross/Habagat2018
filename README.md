# TEST dashboard (DRAFT version) - https://philippineredcross.github.io/Mayon_3W/

## Updates 09.02.2017
This version of the dashboard has the following features:

* During loading of web page, the page items gradually appear on the page showing the progress. 
* From a user-experience perspective: if graphs are relevant for understanding outcomes and if there is no restriction in terms of available space on the site, they need to be made visible.
* Table header names in CSV file do not need to be corrected for spaces. The CSV file can be loaded "as is", providedÂ±
  * the number of columns (11) remains the same for this dashboard, and
  * the csv file has been encoded to UTF-8 format. UTF-8 encoding can be achieved by using Notepad++ tool. From menu, select "Encoding" and then select "Encode in UTF-8" and then save file.
* A dynamic table using JQuery DataTables has been added to enable:
  * Sorting any of the columns in alphabetical order,
  * Shortening of the table by adding pagination of table entries (default number of entries per page: 25), but user can select: 25, 50 or show all entries in table,
  * Searching for table entries using a free text-format. Upon clicking the "Reset button" the search item will be cleared.
* The map showing the provinces and municipalities is automatically zoomed and positioned to fit in the 660 x 800 pixels frame, by:
  * Trimming the entries of the geojson files to only focus on the provinces and municipalities of interest.
  * Using d3's path bound function to obtain coordinates of the rectangle enclosing the targeted provinces and municipalities.
  * Automatically updating the Mercator projection's functions for centering, scaling and translating.
* The code has been commented for ongoing maintenance and allowing further improvements where needed.

## Suggestions
* Using an initialisation file enabling users to quickly update basic information in an HTML file, without the need for them to modify the HTML code. Basic information is for example:
  * Title of natural disaster,
  * Purpose of dashboard,
  * Version information,
  * Release date, and
  * Name of dashboard developer(s)
* Testing of dashboard using a combination of web browsers and operating systems.
